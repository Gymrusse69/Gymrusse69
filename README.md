- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gymrusse69
- 👀 I’m interested in Web-Development, Frontend Development and more or less everything that has to do with programming and its principles 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and refining my skills in HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of Project, that eventually helps me get better at programming
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a carrier pigeon
- 😄 Pronouns: dumb/ass
- ⚡ Fun fact: one of my highest goals in programming is to use my knowledge and combine it with my interest of music
                like for example: create my own Plugins for FL Studio
- 🐒 also forgot to say... I love monkeys (more exactly urangutans and chimpanzees :))
